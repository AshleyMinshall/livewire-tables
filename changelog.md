# Changelog

## 0.3.0
- Added `querySql()` method which returns raw SQL generated by query builder
- Refactored much of the query building in `LivewireModelTable`
	- Separated the “join” logic out of the sorting method. Related tables are joined / eager loaded via the `joinRelated()` method
		- As a result `sortByRelatedField()` is now only responsible for the `orderBy` portion
    - Added `generateQueryFields()` which prepares the $fields array for join / search statements.
	- Only fields specified in `$fields` are selected with the query
	- Removed `whereLike` macro for search, instead loop over supplied searchable fields and build `where` and `orWhere` queries
		- [Bug fix]: `whereLike` macro was failing when sort was on related column and search was performed. Now resolved.


## 0.2.2
- Moved CSS scaffolding responsibility to ScaffoldLivewireTableCommand.
	- As a result we no longer need to construct parent Livewire component in `LivewireModelTable.php`
